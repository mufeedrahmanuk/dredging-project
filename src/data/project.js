    description: 'We involved in the dredging and land reclamation works for the Palm Jumeirah project. The responsibilities included the creation of the island landmass and the construction of the breakwaters.',
    details: 'Boskalis played a crucial role in the construction of the Palm Jumeirah, an iconic man-made island in Dubai, UAE. Their involvement included significant land reclamation work, where they utilized advanced dredging techniques and equipment, such as cutter suction dredgers and trailing suction hopper dredgers, to gather and deposit sand, forming the island\'s structure. Boskalis also constructed the crescent-shaped breakwater, essential for protecting the island from sea erosion and strong waves, using rock placement and marine engineering methods. They managed beach and coastal works, ensuring the island’s beaches were aesthetically pleasing and functional. Additionally, Boskalis implemented environmental management measures to minimize ecological disruption, including monitoring marine life and controlling siltation. The project posed numerous challenges, including extreme weather and high tidal ranges, which Boskalis overcame through innovative engineering solutions. Their work on the Palm Jumeirah not only contributed to Dubai’s economic growth but also showcased their expertise in executing large-scale and complex marine construction projects.',

    description: 'For this extraordinary EPC project we dredged a new harbor basin and entrance channel with a depth of 18 meters, constructed a kilometer-long quay wall, two 400 meter-long jetties and reclaimed land for a port platform including ground improvement and associated 4 km shore protection.',
    details: 'Boskalis has been instrumental in the development of Duqm Port, a major infrastructure project in Oman. Their involvement began with extensive dredging and reclamation efforts, using advanced equipment to deepen the port basin and create additional land necessary for the port’s infrastructure. This critical work ensures the port can accommodate large vessels, including container ships and oil tankers. Additionally, Boskalis constructed robust breakwaters to protect the port from environmental challenges such as strong waves and erosion, thereby ensuring safe and efficient maritime operations. Their commitment to environmental management involved mitigating ecological impacts through sedimentation control and marine life monitoring, adhering to regulations to preserve the local ecosystem. Through these efforts, Boskalis has significantly contributed to transforming Duqm Port into a deep-water, multi-purpose hub, enhancing regional connectivity and supporting Oman’s broader economic diversification goals.',

    description: 'The Dangote Group, owned by Aliko Dangote, is building Africa’s largest oil refinery and fertilizer plant in Lekki, 60 kilometers east of Lagos, Nigeria. To facilitate the import of out-of-gauge components and other materials required for construction activities, a port was constructed',
    details: 'Boskalis plays a critical role in the development of greenfield ports, leveraging its expertise in marine construction and dredging. In a greenfield port project, Boskalis typically handles the initial and most complex phases, starting with extensive land reclamation and dredging. They use advanced dredging equipment to create the necessary land and deepen navigable channels and basins, ensuring that the port can accommodate large vessels and handle significant cargo volumes. Additionally, Boskalis constructs essential coastal protection structures such as breakwaters, which safeguard the port from environmental challenges like strong waves and erosion, ensuring safe and uninterrupted operations. Their involvement also includes implementing rigorous environmental management practices to mitigate the ecological impact of construction activities. This includes sedimentation control, marine life monitoring, and adherence to environmental regulations. Through these efforts, Boskalis contributes significantly to establishing a greenfield port with state-of-the-art infrastructure, designed to meet modern logistical demands and support regional economic growth.',
